    You drudge heavily to the door of the next room, 'Room ZZZ.'
    It used to say '777', but someone's written on the plaque with a faded magic marker.

        - - (not_police)
        You knock politely on the door.
    
    * (police)[Knock officiously.]
        You rap your knuckles against the door in an official sort of way. One that makes it clear you have questions you expect to be answered.

    "It's open," comes a weak voice from inside. "I'm afraid I can't let you in myself, but please, do come in."

    "I'm terribly sorry." The voice comes again as you step inside. "Things are, I confess, a bit of a mess hereabouts at the moment. I'm afraid my health has been...—and you see I do so rarely have the chance to receive anyone at all these days."
    
    You step into the cramped room and a tall, thin man smiles bashfully at you from beneath the covers of a bed in the center of the room. 
        
    MR S: "Call me MR S. And please, it's not an alias. It's simply my name."
